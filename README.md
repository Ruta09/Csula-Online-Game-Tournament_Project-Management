# Online Gaming Tournament
Due to Covid-19 outbreak, many universities were forced to conduct classes online for the 2019-2020 academic year. This drastic change among the students has caused students to face unique challenges, adversely impacting the studentâ€™s mental health. To avoid any furthermore outbreak among the students I at CSULA am planning to conduct an online gaming tournament. An online gaming tournament is a much kind of break needed for the students to come out from their lazy comfort zone to start using their mind and participate actively in the tournament. This not only helps the students to be active but also helps them to engage and have a stress-free mind which in turn encourages the students to attend the university and enjoy the fun, at the same time while attending the classes in person too.
